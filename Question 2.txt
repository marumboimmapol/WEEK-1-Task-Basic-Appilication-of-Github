The factorial of the integer n , written n! , is defined as:

n! = n x n (n - 1) x ( n - 2) x … x 3 x 2 x 1


Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if n = 30 , we calculate  30 x 29 x 28 x … x 2 x 1 and get its value.

Function Description

Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the code given below below. It should print the result and return.

extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):

n: an integer
Note: Factorials of n>20 can't be stored even in a 64 - bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.
